        <h3>
          Well, what's this? I thought we were in Argentina. Why are they coming
          back with Bavarian culture and Oktoberfest again? Are you serious?
        </h3>

        <h3>
          The Argentinian town of La Cumbrecita was founded in 1934 by German
          immigrants. All street signs are in German, and a giant cuckoo clock
          greets visitors upon entering the town. The houses and food are
          reminiscent of Bavarian culture, and Oktoberfest is celebrated here as
          well. Tourists come from all over Argentina to experience this bizarre
          vision of a miniature Germany. Here, they can enjoy apple strudel in
          the caf√© and purchase small trinkets in the gift shops. <br />The
          locals live in wooden houses, some of which speak German. Great
          importance is placed on living in harmony with nature. This makes La
          Cumbrecita one of the most sustainable towns in the country. All of
          its electricity is generated from renewable energy. In addition to
          treating water for reuse, materials such as plastics, glass, and
          metals are recycled, and organic waste is turned into garden compost.
