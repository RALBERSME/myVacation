            <h1>
              Juan Domingo Perón <br />(* 8. Oktober 1895 in Lobos; † 1. Juli
              1974 in Olivos, Buenos Aires)
            </h1>
            <p>
              Juan Domingo Perón was one of the most important figures in
              Argentine history. He first came to power in 1946 and
              significantly shaped the country for many years. His rise began
              during World War II, while he was serving in the military. After
              the war, he exploited popular discontent and political instability
              to distinguish himself as a leader of the labor movement. In 1946,
              he was elected President of Argentina. He gained his popularity
              primarily through social reforms that benefited workers and
              nationalist policies that sought to strengthen Argentina's
              independence.
              <br /><br />
              During his term in office, Perón implemented a number of
              significant measures. He emphasized social justice, improved
              working conditions, introduced pensions and social benefits, and
              promoted industry. His policies became known as "Peronism," a
              mixture of socialism, nationalism, and populism. He also showed
              support in culture: He promoted Argentine music, literature, and
              sports, which strengthened national self-confidence.
              <br />
              But Perón's reign was not only marked by positive changes. His
              authoritarian approach to controlling the media and the repression
              of political opponents led to tensions in the country.
              Furthermore, his close collaboration with fascist regimes in
              Europe was criticized. His policies also led to economic problems,
              as government spending increased and inflation rose.
              <br /><br />
              In 1952, Perón was elected for a third time, but his rule became
              increasingly unsettled. In 1955, a military coup forced him into
              exile. Perón was forced to flee to Spain, where he initially lived
              in exile. Despite his absence, he remained a central figure in
              Argentine politics. He supported political movements in Argentina
              from the outside and tried to mobilize his supporters.
              <br />
              He returned to Argentina in 1973 after being re-elected president.
              His return was celebrated by many as a liberation. However, his
              second term was marked by political tensions and economic
              difficulties. Perón died on July 1, 1974, at the age of 78. After
              his death, his wife, Isabel Perón, assumed the presidency, but the
              political situation remained unstable.
              <br />
              Perón's influence on Argentina is still felt today. His policies
              had a lasting impact on the Argentine economy, culture, and
              society. Peronism remains an important political movement that
              emphasizes both social justice and national independence.
              <br /><br />
              Perón's character was characterized by charm, assertiveness, and a
              strong connection to the workers. Despite his controversial
              policies, Juan Domingo Perón remains a central figure in Argentine
              history, whose influence still resonates.

            <h1>
              María Eva Duarte de Perón<br />
              (also called Eva Duarte, Evita, * 7. Mai 1919 in Los Toldos; † 26.
              Juli 1952 in Buenos Aires)
            </h1>
            <p>
              Evita Perón, whose full name was María Eva Duarte de Perón, was
              born on May 7, 1919, into a poor family in Argentina. She grew up
              in a difficult environment and moved to Buenos Aires at a young
              age to pursue a career as an actress. There she met Juan Domingo
              Perón, the future President of Argentina, whom she married in
              1945. Through her relationship with Perón, she quickly became a
              well-known figure and passionately committed herself to helping
              Argentina's poor and disadvantaged people. <br /><br />
              Evita became famous primarily through her work for the labor
              movement and her support of social projects. She advocated for
              women's rights and social justice and became a symbol of Peronism.
              Her popularity grew enormously, and she was revered by many
              Argentinians. The song "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" ("No llores
              por mí, Argentina"), recorded in 1976 by the Argentinian singer
              Mercedes Sosa, became particularly well-known. The song expressed
              the people's admiration and pride for Evita, but also her
              sacrifice and influence on the country. For the Argentinians at
              the time, it represented a memory of a woman who had stood up for
              the poor and who had a strong emotional connection to her people.
              <br /><br />
              Today, the song remains a symbol of Evita's legacy and the hope
              for social justice. It commemorates her role as a fighter for the
              less fortunate and the deep emotions she evoked in many
              Argentines. Evita Perón remains a legendary figure who continues
              to play a significant role in Argentine culture and history.

            <h1>The period after Perón until today</h1>
            <p>
              After the death of Juan Domingo Perón in 1974, his third wife,
              Isabel Perón, assumed the presidency. Her term was marked by
              political tensions, economic problems, and increasing instability.
              In 1976, a military coup ushered in a dictatorship that lasted
              until 1983. During this period, human rights were severely
              violated, opposition figures were persecuted, and the economy
              suffered from inflation and mismanagement.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 1983, democracy returned to Argentina, and Raúl Alfonsín became
              president. He worked to address human rights violations and
              implemented democratic reforms. However, the economic situation
              remained difficult, with high inflation and unemployment. In the
              1990s, Carlos Menem came to power, pursuing neoliberal economic
              policies, implementing privatizations, and initially stabilizing
              the economy. However, this also led to social inequalities and
              economic crises.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 2001, Argentina experienced a severe economic crisis, which led
              to mass protests and political instability. Several presidential
              changes followed in a short period of time. In 2003, Néstor
              Kirchner became president, followed by his wife, Cristina
              Fernández de Kirchner, who remained in office until 2015. During
              her term, she attempted to strengthen social programs and
              stabilize the economy, but she too had to contend with economic
              challenges and allegations of corruption.
              <br />
              <br />
              Mauricio Macri has been president since 2015, pursuing economic
              openness and reforms. However, his policies led to a renewed
              economic crisis, and in 2019, Alberto Fernández was elected
              president, with Cristina Fernández as vice president. The current
              situation is characterized by economic difficulties, inflation,
              and social tensions, but also by efforts to restabilize the
              country.
              <br />
              <br />
              Overall, Argentina's history after Perón's abdication has been
              marked by political upheavals, economic crises, and the struggle
              for democracy and social justice. The country has repeatedly
              experienced phases of prosperity and crisis, but remains an
              important nation in South America with a rich culture and history.

            <h1>
              The new hope: <br />Javier Gerardo Milei <br />(* 22. Oktober 1970
              in Palermo, Buenos Aires)
            </h1>
            <p>
              On December 10, 2023, Milei became the new president with the goal
              of reforming Argentina. At the beginning of his term, Milei
              announced a "shock therapy" economic reform. He presented three
              reform packages: a ten-point plan, an emergency decree with 366
              articles, and a legislative package for a state of emergency until
              2025. The ten-point plan included a devaluation of the peso,
              spending cuts, privatizations, and pension reforms. He tightened
              security and immigration policies, deployed the military
              domestically, and restricted the right to demonstrate.
              <br /><br />In foreign policy, he stopped Argentina's accession to
              the BRICS and announced his withdrawal from the WHO. Protests and
              general strikes against the austerity measures led to nationwide
              unrest. Milei later scaled back some reform plans, but courts
              overturned parts of his labor market reforms. In 2024, GDP fell by
              1.8%, while the economy showed a slight recovery in the third
              quarter. Despite criticism, over half of the population still
              rated his government positively. <br /><br />
              As an interim report (early 2025), one can currently state: Javier
              Milei is recording initial economic successes in Argentina,
              including falling inflation, declining poverty, and a budget
              surplus. His austerity measures led to job cuts in the public
              sector, but wages are rising faster than inflation. Argentina has
              also become a net energy exporter with a trade surplus. However,
              there is criticism due to a cryptocurrency scandal and his
              conservative social policies. Despite challenges, his party
              remains relatively strong with 36% approval.
